summary: |
  This influential paper introduces the concept of Green AI, which encourages AI research that yields better results while consuming less computing power and thus lower environmental impact.

  The authors contrast Green AI with what they call Red AI: research that seeks to improve accuracy through massive computational power, regardless of the environmental cost.

  The paper proposes new evaluation criteria for AI research that include computational efficiency alongside accuracy, encouraging more sustainable approaches to AI development.
