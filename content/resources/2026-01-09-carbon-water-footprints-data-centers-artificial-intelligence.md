summary: |
  Although there are ways to estimate the global power demand of AI systems, it remains challenging to quantify the associated carbon and water footprints. The lack of distinction between AI and non-AI workloads in the environmental reports of data center operators makes it possible to assess the environmental impact of AI workloads only by approximating them through data centers' general performance metrics. The environmental disclosure of tech companies is, however, often insufficient to determine even the total data center performance of these companies.

  The carbon footprint of AI systems alone could be between 32.6 and 79.7 million tons of CO2 emissions in 2025, while the water footprint could reach 312.5–764.6 billion liters.

  The shortcomings in the environmental disclosure of data center operators could be remedied with new policies mandating the disclosure of additional metrics. Because the environmental impact of data centers is growing rapidly, the urgency of transparency in the tech sector is also increasing.
